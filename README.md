# yellowcode

this app will generate a workable  QR code which then can be used by the UPI Apps. 
The link embadded in QR code is static since i didn't got that much time to create fully functional application. 

In the beginning, i was writing backen in django and got stuck in a problem which i was unable to resolve.
Then i switched my backend from django to node in last 4hrs.

It was a roller coaster and fun at YelloCode ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•
